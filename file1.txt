preconceptions. As a result, people recall information from 
memory selectively, and interpret it in a biased way, in particular 
for emotionally significant issues and established beliefs. 
Biased search, interpretation and recall have been invoked to 
explain attitude polarization (disagreeing parties diverging 
further when they are exposed to the same evidence), belief 
perseverance (beliefs persisting after the evidence for them 
is shown to be false), the primacy effect (data encountered early 
in a series being given more weight) and illusory correlation (people falsely perceiving an association between two events or situations). Explanations for these biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Confirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence.
